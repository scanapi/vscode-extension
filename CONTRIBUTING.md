## Install

### Requirements:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)


Clone the repository and enter into the project's folder:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:scanapi/vscode-extension.git
$ cd vscode-extension
```

Install the dependencies:

```shell
$ npm install
```

## Run

```shell
$ npm run vscode:prepublish
```

Then, open the vscode-extension folder inside the editor:

```shell
$ code .

Select the file `src/extension.ts` and press `F5`. Select the option `VS Code Extension Development (Preview)`.

This will compile and run the extension in a new Extension Development Host window. There you can test the extension running locally.
